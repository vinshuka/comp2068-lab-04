LAB 04 - Instructions

OBJECTIVE:
  Demonstrate your knowledge of the various components that make up MVC (Models, Views, Controllers, and Routing)

STEPS:
  1) /models/product.js - Create a new model schema and assign
     it to the ProductSchema constant. The fields you'll need
     are:
     - name (String)
     - description (String)
     - price (Number)

  2) /controllers/ProductsController.js - Fill out the create
     and show actions:
     - The create action should take the form data
       and create a new product form it.
     - The create action should redirect to show (not render)
     - If there's an error just console.error it
     - The show action should retrieve the requested product
       from the database
     - The show action should render the show view passing the
       selected user
     - Edit the .env so your environment variables are present
  
  3) /views/products/show.js - Create a nice view to display
     a selected product.
     - Use Bootstrap to make it look clean and tidy
     - Display the name, description, and price
  
  4) Push all code to Github
  5) Deploy your application to Heroku
     - Don't forget to add your environment variables
